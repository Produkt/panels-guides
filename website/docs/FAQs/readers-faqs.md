**- How to use “Continue reading”**

Continue reading works for files within the same folder. Once you reach the end, you can continue scrolling to jump to the next title.
At this moment, continue reading does not work while streaming OPDS. This will be introduced when OPDS 2.0 is finally released and adopted both from Panels and from OPDS servers.
