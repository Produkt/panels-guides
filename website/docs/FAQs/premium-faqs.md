# Purchases and Subscriptions

**- What is the difference between Panels+ and Panels 3?**

No. Panels Premium is a 1 time only purchase. We offer a custom trial period where we allow you to try all Premium features for 5 days. After the 5 days, the trial will be automatically finished and you will go back to Panels Free.

**- If I buy or subscribe to Panels in one device, can I also get it in another one? Or do I need to pay again?**

You don't need to pay again. As long as you use the same Apple ID, you can go to settings and tap "Restore purchases". Even if you try to buy Premium again with the same Apple ID you won't be charged twice.

**- Can I share Panels purchases with my family members?**

**- I removed Panels and lost my Premium access. How can I get it back? Do I need to pay again?**
