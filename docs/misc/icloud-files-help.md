# iCloud Drive: Keeping Files Downloaded on iOS

If you use iCloud Drive as a cloud library in Panels, your comics might be deleted by the system without warning. This happens when iOS automatically removes files from your device to free up storage space, even though the files remain safely stored in iCloud. When you try to open a comic that has been offloaded, you'll see an error message saying the file is not available.

This guide explains why this happens and how to prevent it by marking your important comics to stay downloaded on your device.

**Note**: The "Keep Downloaded" feature requires iOS 18 or later. For earlier iOS versions, files will be managed automatically by the system.

## Why Files Get Removed

iOS automatically manages storage by offloading files from iCloud Drive when your device is running low on space. This is a system feature designed to free up storage while keeping your files safely stored in iCloud.

### When iOS Removes Files

iOS may remove local copies of iCloud files in these situations:

- **Low Storage**: When your device storage is running low
- **Infrequent Access**: Files that haven't been accessed recently
- **Large Files**: Bigger files are more likely to be offloaded first
- **System Optimization**: iOS continuously optimizes storage based on usage patterns
- **App Offloading**: When apps are offloaded, their associated files may also be removed

## How to Keep Files Downloaded

### Using the Files App

1. **Open the Files app** on your iOS device
2. **Navigate to your iCloud Drive** folder containing your comics
3. **Long press on a file or folder** you want to keep downloaded
4. **Select "Keep Downloaded"** from the context menu
5. **Look for the download icon** (↓) to disappear, indicating the file is now marked to stay local

### Visual Indicators

- **Cloud icon (☁️)**: File is in iCloud but not downloaded locally
- **Download icon (↓)**: File can be downloaded on demand
- **No icon**: File is stored locally on your device
- **Progress circle**: File is currently downloading
