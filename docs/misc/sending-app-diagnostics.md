# Sending App Diagnostics

Some bugs require additional information that we can't access remotely. In those cases, we'd like you to send us App Diagnostics. 
Here are some steps to extract the `.ips` files containing the crash logs from the app. 

Open your settings app and navigate to  
**Settings**  >  **Privacy**  >  **Analytics**  >  **Analytics**  **Data** , you should see a list of files prefixed with the name of the app that created it.

You should see one or more prefixed with "**Panels-**"

If you open each file, you can send it to us or another device. 
The more you send us, the better. Especially the most **recent** ones.

Thanks!!!
