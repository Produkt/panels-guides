# Multiple libraries

A Panels library is just a folder (containing other folders and/or files). You can access your default folder using Files app, navigating to "On my iPhone/iPad" -> Panels (the folder has the Panels app icon on it).

Panels creates a default library when the app is installed. You will see the this library inside Panels referred to as "On my iPhone/iPad".

## Adding more libraries

From within Panels app, you can add more libraries. Those libraries can be other folders located in your devices, can be [other folders located in iCloud Drive](/import-content/icloud-drive.md), [located in your own server](/opds/opds.md) or they can even be located in an **external disk connected via cable**.

To add a new library, simply go to the library tab, go back to Content, tap on the "..." icon and select add a new library.
Locate the root folder and tap Open.
