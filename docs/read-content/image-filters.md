# Image filters

Panels offers a way to tweak images in the reader for better reading experience. We like to differentiate between 3 groups: filters, transformations and shaders.

To access turn them on/off, simply tap "..." -> Image filters.

## Filters

Filters only tweak images visually.

- Reduce noise: works well for old scans with lots of color noise
- Increase sharpness

## Transformations

Transformations change the geometry/size of pages.

- Remove borders: tries to identify a vertical or horizontal border near the edge where all pixels are of a similar color.

## Shaders

Shaders are filters that take into account the image size, as well as the display size.

- Reduce moire effect: apply this filter when patterns in drawings show moire effect.

:::tip

You can apply multiple filters.
