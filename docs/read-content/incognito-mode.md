# Icognito mode

Panels [stores and syncs your reading sessions](../misc/sync-reading-sessions.md). That means, for each comic you open and read, we associate some information to it (like time spent reading). We use that information to drive "Reading now" screen.

When incognito mode is enabled, those reading sessions are marked as hidden, so the information about time reading is still stored, but those comics will not appear in reading now.
