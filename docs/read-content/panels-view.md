# Enabling Panels View

**Panels View** is a navigation system that allows you to explore comics panel by panel. Leveraging advanced machine learning models trained on hundreds of comic pages, this feature detects and zooms into individual panels, enhancing your reading experience â€” especially on smaller screens.

As of this guide's writing, Panels View is still in the experimental phase. While we have made significant improvements over the years, the results may not yet meet the high standards we aim to provide for our users.

To enable Panels View, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Navigate to Panels Labs.
3. Toggle on "Panels View Reader".

Once enabled, you will see a new option while reading that allows you to toggle panel-by-panel navigation on or off.
