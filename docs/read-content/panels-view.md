# Enabling Panels View

**Panels View** is a navigation system that allows you to explore comics panel by panel. Leveraging advanced machine learning models trained on hundreds of comic pages, this feature detects and zooms into individual panels, enhancing your reading experience â€” especially on smaller screens.
