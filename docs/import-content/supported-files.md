# Supported files

Panels supports the following formats:

- cbz (zip)
- cbr (rar)
- cb7 (7z)
- pdf
- comic ePUBs\*

Container files (like cbz/cbr/cb7) can contain jpg, png and webp files.

:::info

**Comic ePUBs**: Panels can open epub files but will warn you when trying to open a text ePUB. We do not support text formatting, our app's main focus is on image-based books, so don't expect support for text books.
