# OPDS: Your own server

If you have a large comic collection or you just don't want your files to take out too much space in your device, you can choose to [have your content stored on iCloud Drive](icloud-drive.md) or have it stored in your own server.

Panels can connect to server using the OPDS protocol. There are multiple server implementations that are compatible with OPDS. For comics in particular, we do recommend using [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/), [Komga](https://komga.org/) or [Codex](https://github.com/ajslater/codex).

Each one of those servers offer great documentation and communities around them, so we strongly suggest you visit them to set your server up.

For Komga in particular, we added a full guide on how to set it up with Panels: https://komga.org/docs/guides/panels

All OPDS servers operate similarly from Panels' side, so we recommend following that guide.
